# PortfolioApp

This is a sample app I developed to play around with Animations and build some sort of personal app to show off on interviews and recruiters.

It supports mobile web with react-native-web and the steps to launch it are the following:

- run `yarn`
- For web, run `yarn web`
- For iOS, run `yarn ios`
- For Android, run `yarn android`
